# Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog!

## About Me
I’m a student studying Artificial Intelligence, passionate about learning, sharing, and growing every day.

## What This Blog Is About
This blog is a space where I:
- Explain hard and complex topics in simple words
- Break down ideas for people who:
  - Have difficulties with technical concepts  
  - Are non-technical users  
  - Want to learn without feeling overwhelmed  

I believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone, not just experts.

## Topics You’ll Find Here
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  
- Programming concepts explained simply  
- Technology for beginners  
- Learning notes, personal thoughts, and insights  

## Philosophy
- Simple explanations over complicated jargon  
- Learning should be enjoyable, not stressful  
- Everyone can understand technology with the right explanation  

## Beyond Tech
I also enjoy life, learning new things, and keeping a healthy balance between studies, curiosity, and fun.

## Goal
If you read one post and think:
> “That wasn’t as hard as I thought.”

Then this blog is doing its job.
